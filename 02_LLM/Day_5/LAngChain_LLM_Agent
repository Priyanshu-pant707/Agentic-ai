# LangChain 
-  it is a frame work  that helps you t build LLM-powered applications using small building block like :
    - LLMs
    - Prompts
    - Memory
    - Tools/APIs
    - Chains and Agents

- Langchain makes it easier to connect LLMs with real-world data , tools and logic .



## KeyConcepts :

- LLM : The brain
- Prompt : what do you ask the LLM
- Output Parser : Helps convert the LLM's response into a structured format 
- Chain : A sequence like :
    -> Prompt -> LLM -> Praser -> output
- Memory :  Keeps context between interactions 

- Agent : Think of it like a smart decision maker
    -  it can :
        -  decide what tool to use
        - think step by step
        - call external tools
        -  act like a mini Ai worker.



``` LangChain gives you more than just "chains" and "agents" 
- chains and agents are the two most important "high - level tools", but LangChain provides a full toolbox to help you build complete AI-powered apps.


```




## Chain

- a chain means connectiong building block together .
- it is a rule based .  No thinking or decisions involved.




## Agent

- imagine your app needs to think, make decisions , and choose tool dynamically .

- an agent is powered by an LLM and a list of tools
- the agent decides what to do next - it reasons and acts.





``` 
- just connect LLM + Prompt  -> use chain
- need decision making or tool use -> use agent 


```





## LCEL ?

- it stands for Langchain expression language
- it is a newer , more composable , modular and future proof way to build llm pipelines using ***.pipe()*** and ***.invoke()*** instead of older abstactions like LLMChain.
