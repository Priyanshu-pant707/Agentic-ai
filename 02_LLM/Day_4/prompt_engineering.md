# Prompt Engineering ?
- it is the art and science of asking the right question to an LLM.
- LLMs respond based on your input , so better prompts = better answer.
- Like talking to a very smart assistant,
- your clarity = their quality.



### structure :
system prmpt (who the ai is)+ instruction (what you want it to do ) +  input (how you want it done).



## types of prompting techniques :


1. ROLEPLAY PROMPTING :

- you are telling the ai to pretend to be someone specific - like a teacher,co-founder,doctor. This changes to the tone,context,and perspective of the answer.


2. Chain of Thought Prompting :
- you are asking the LLM to think out loud and show the reasoning behind each step, instead of jumping to the final answer.


3. Few-Shot Prompting :
- give 2-3 examples then ask it to generate a similar one.







## Some important point related to prompt engineering :

1.  improve accuracy of responses .
2.  customize output format.
3. Guide reasoning and logic.
4. Extract information from text.
5. Summarize long content.
6. Answer questions
7. Classify text.
8. Generate code.
9. Translate or rephrase text.
10. Create Role- based conversions
11. Build smart assistants or chatbots.
12. inject domain knowledge.
13. Enhance model reliability with self-consistency.
14. generate structured data.
15. boost creativity or content writing.
16. simulate exams or interviews.
17. Debug or Fix Code.
18. Personalize Outputs.
